## Download

### Picroft

Picroft is specifically packaged to run on a Raspberry Pi 3 or 3B+. It is built on top of the official Raspbian Stretch Lite and is available as a disk image ready to be burned to a Micro SD card. For Chatterbox to hear you and respond to you, just connect a speaker and a USB microphone to your Pi.

### Windows and Mac

We’re not quite ready to release Chatterbox natively for Windows and macOS. If you are keen to help and have technical experience on these platforms, please let us know!

However you can run Chatterbox on MacOS and Windows inside a virtual machine using VirtualBox.

### Mark 1

Mark 1 is a no-fuss way to get started. It has been designed specifically to work with Chatterbox’s capabilities as a standalone device. Great for those who aren’t super technical, but it can be easily extended, altered, modified, and hacked.

_The Mark 1 is currently sold out._
