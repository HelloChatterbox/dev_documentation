# Why use Chatterbox AI?

Why would you choose to use Chatterbox over alternatives such as Amazon™ Alexa™, Google Assistant™, Microsoft Cortana™ or Apple's Siri™?

Great question!

While alternative tools are readily available, and easy to use, they come with some pretty big downsides.

## Open source

Chatterbox is built on top of mycroft-core, the world's first open source voice assistant

Tools like Amazon™ Alexa™, Google Assistant™, Microsoft Cortana™ or Apple's Siri™ are _black boxes_. That is, you can't look inside them, and see what they do - or importantly - _how_ they do it. And while they may allow you some flexibility to create new **Skills**, these are usually strictly controlled. Chatterbox gives you freedom, flexibility and control over how your want _your_ voice assistant to work. Chatterbox is AI for _everyone_.

## Respecting your privacy

Chatterbox uses zero knowledge privacy, you don't need an account, we take no metrics, we don't save any data and we don't know who you are

You're welcome to view our [privacy policy](https://chatterbox.ai/privacy-policy/)

## Lightweight

Chatterbox is lightweight, and will run on low-powered hardware, such as the Raspberry Pi 3. So if you're a Hacker, Maker or Hobbyist, it's the perfect platform for low cost experimentation.
