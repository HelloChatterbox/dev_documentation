# Your First Skill

## Prerequisites

If you haven't already, check out our [Introduction to Skill Development](./). This walk through assumes you:

* Know some basic knowledge of [Python programming](https://www.python.org/),
* have an account on [Github.com](https://github.com), and
* have a [working version of Chatterbox](https://github.com/HelloChatterbox/dev_documentation/tree/fa8dd19ece396fdac40a643e544472fe7433b789/docs/using-chatterbox-ai/get-chatterbox/README.md).

## Understand the flow of your Skill

It's a good idea to start by writing down how your Skill will work, including

* What words will the User speak to activate the Skill?
* What will Chatterbox speak in response?
* What data will you need to deliver the Skill?
* Will you need any additional packages or dependencies?

Once you've given these some thought, you can get started.
