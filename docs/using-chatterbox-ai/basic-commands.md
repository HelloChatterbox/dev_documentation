  these to get started.

# Basic Commands

You issue a command to Chatterbox by pushing the big yellow button, awaiting acknowledgement from Chatterbox, and then Speaking the command itself \(aka the **utterance**\).

When you issue a command, you _intend_ for Chatterbox to react in a certain way. Your **utterance** contains an **Intent**. Chatterbox uses natural language processing to compare the words in your **utterance** to expected phrases or keywords as supplied by the installed **Skills**. When Chatterbox determines that there is a _match_ between your **utterance** and a specific expectation \(the phrases/keywords\), the **Skill** that supplied the matching expectation is notified so that it can respond to your command.

Chatterbox comes with a collection of **Skills** installed by default. Each **Skill** supplies a set of **Intents**, and each **Intent** has a set of expected phrases or keywords. Each of the default **Skills** is introduced below with a brief description, followed by a sampling of expected **utterances** \(usually grouped by **Intent**\). Additional **Skills** may be added to your Chatterbox Device; please see [Installing New Skills](https://chatterbox-ai.gitbook.io/docs/using-chatterbox-ai/installing-new-skills).

Have fun exploring natural language processing by trying these commands with variations to the wording and phrasing.
