# Why use Chatterbox AI?

Why would you choose to use Chatterbox over alternatives such as Amazon™ Alexa™, Google Assistant™, Microsoft Cortana™ or Apple's Siri™?

Great question!

While alternative tools are readily available, and easy to use, they come with some pretty big downsides.

## Open source

Chatterbox is open source. This means that the code used by Chatterbox can be inspected, copied, modified, and contributed back to the Chatterbox community for everyone to enjoy.

Tools like Amazon™ Alexa™, Google Assistant™, Microsoft Cortana™ or Apple's Siri™ are _black boxes_. That is, you can't look inside them, and see what they do - or importantly - _how_ they do it. And while they may allow you some flexibility to create new **Skills**, these are usually strictly controlled. Chatterbox gives you freedom, flexibility and control over how your want _your_ voice assistant to work. Chatterbox is AI for _everyone_.

Chatterbox code is licensed under the [Apache 2 open source license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License).

## Respecting your privacy

Chatterbox uses _opt-in privacy_. This means we will only record what you say to Chatterbox with your explicit permission. Don't want us to record your voice? No problem! If you'd like us to help Chatterbox become more accurate, you can opt in to have your voice anonymously recorded.

## More hardware, more choices

Chatterbox runs on a wide range of software platforms and hardware - meaning that you can run Chatterbox on the **Devices** _you_ want. Try Chatterbox on a Raspberry Pi, on an Android device - or on your Linux desktop.

## Lightweight

Chatterbox is lightweight, and will run on low-powered hardware, such as the Raspberry Pi 3. So if you're a Hacker, Maker or Hobbyist, it's the perfect platform for low cost experimentation.
