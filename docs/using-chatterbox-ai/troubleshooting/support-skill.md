# Support Skill

## Using the Support Skill

We have implemented a [Support Skill](https://github.com/ChatterboxAI/skill-support) as a core \(default\) **Skill** on all Chatterbox **Devices**. This means that you can generate information about what the **Device** is doing. This information is then anonymously emailed to us, so we can review it for problems.

To generate information for a Support Ticket, say any of these phrases:

> "I need support", "Create a support request", "Create a support ticket"

Chatterbox will then ask:

`"do you want to send an anonymous support request?"`

If you answer yes an email with device logs will be sent to the Chatterbox support team, these logs are anonymous and can not be tied to you

Chatterbox will speak a 4 word code, you can email the Chatterbox support team with this code and questions or extra information, without this we can not give you any feedback
