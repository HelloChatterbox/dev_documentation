# Installing New Skills

{% hint style="info" %}
The [Skills Marketplace](https://market.chatterbox.ai/skills) is a curated list of Voice Skills that have been tested and approved by the Chatterbox Community.
{% endhint %}

## Voice Installation

The simplest way to install a new Skill is to ask Chatterbox to do it for you by saying:

> Hey Chatterbox, install {skill name}

This will search the Skills Marketplace and install them on your device.

## Removing a Skill

To remove the Skill, you can say:

> Hey Chatterbox, uninstall {skill name}

## Command Line

If you prefer to use the command line, you can directly use the [Chatterbox Skills Manager](../skill-development/chatterbox-skills-manager/).

To install a Skill run:

```text
chatterbox-msm install skill-name
```

To remove a Skill run:

```text
chatterbox-msm remove skill-name
```
