### Find the IP address of my device

To obtain your devices IP address you can say:

> Hey Chatterbox, what is your IP?

Alternatively you can get the IP address from your router, or by scanning the network using a tool like nmap. Running `nmap` with the no port scan flag `-sn` returns the IP and MAC addresses, as well as the vendor name. A Mark 1 will display as "Raspberry Pi Foundation".
