# Pairing Your Device

Each of your Chatterbox **Device\(s\)** must be **Paired** with your [home.chatterbox.ai](https://home.chatterbox.ai) account.

Pairing is used for services that require API authentication, such as

* Wolfram Alpha
* Google Speech to Text
* Weather Skill API and OpenWeather

You can find documentation on pairing at https://chatterbox.gitbook.io/chatterbox/build-your-chatterbox/connecting-to-wifi

### Where is my identity information stored in the Chatterbox code?

Once you have paired your Chatterbox Device, pairing information is stored in:

`~/.chatterbox/identity/identity2.json`

DO NOT SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH OTHERS - IT IS YOUR CHATTERBOX IDENTITY

You may be asked for this information by Chatterbox support staff while troubleshooting Device and/or Pairing issues.
